# About me

👋 Passionate digital architect with over 14 years of experience in the world of design and web development. 🚀 My background as a former Web Designer and Front-end Developer has allowed me to hone my aesthetic sense, master accessibility challenges, and develop a keen expertise in designing intuitive and engaging user interfaces. 💻🎨 This dual skill set, cultivated over the years, allows me today to approach the creation of Design Systems with a perspective focused on both the end-user and the developer experience. 👀
